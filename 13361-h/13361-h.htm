<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>FURTHER NOTES ON DERIVATION OF THE WORD "NEWS".</h3>
<p>Without being what the Germans would call a <i>purist</i>, I
cannot deem it an object of secondary importance to defend the
principles of the law and constitution of the English language. For
the adoption of words we have no rule; and we act just as our
convenience or necessity dictates: but in their formation we must
strictly conform to the laws we find established. Your
correspondents C.B. and A.E.B. (Vol. ii., p. 23.) seem to me
strangely to misconceive the real point at issue between us. To a
question by the latter, why I should attempt to derive "News"
indirectly from a German adjective, I answer, because in its
transformation into a German noun declined as an adjective, it
gives the form which I contend no English process will give. The
rule your correspondents deduce from this, neither of them, it
appears, can understand. As I am not certain that their deduction
is a correct one, I beg to express it in my own words as
follows:&mdash;There is no such process known to the English
language as the formation of a noun-singular out of an adjective by
the addition of "<i>s</i>": neither is there any process known by
which a noun-plural can be formed from an adjective, without the
previous formation of the singular in the same sense; except in
such cases as "the rich, the poor, the noble," &amp;c., where the
singular form is used in a plural sense. C.B. instances "goods, the
shallows, blacks, for mourning, greens." To the first of these I
have already referred; "shallow" is unquestionably a noun-singular;
and to the remaining instances the following remarks will
apply.</p>
<p>As it should be understood that my argument applies solely to
the <i>English</i> language, I think I might fairly take exception
to a string of instances with which A.E.B. endeavours to refute me
from a vocabulary of a language very expressive, no doubt, yet
commonly called "slang". The words in question are not English: I
never use them myself, nor do I recognise the right or necessity
for any one else to do so; and I might, indeed, deem this a
sufficient answer. But the fact is that the language in some degree
is losing its instincts, and liberties are taken with it now that
it would not have allowed in its younger days. Have we not seen
participial adjectives made from nouns? I shall therefore waive my
objection, and answer by saying that there is no analogy between
the instances given and the case in point. They are, one and all,
elliptical expressions signifying "black clothes, green vegetables,
tight pantaloons, heavy dragoons, odd chances," &amp;c. "Blacks"
and "whites" are not in point, the singular of either being quite
as admissible as the plural. The rule, if it be worth while to lay
down a rule for the formation of such vulgarisms, appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>{82}</span>
to be that characteristic adjective, in constant conjunction with a
noun in common use, may be used alone, the noun being understood.
Custom has limited in some measure the use of these abridged titles
to classes or collective bodies, and the adjective takes the same
form that the noun itself would have had; but, in point of fact, it
would be just as good English to say "a heavy" as "the heavies" and
they all become unintelligible when we lose sight of the noun to
which they belong. If A.E.B. should assert that a glass of "cold
without," <i>because</i>, by those accustomed to indulge in such
potations, it was understood to mean "brandy and <i>cold</i> water,
<i>without</i> sugar," was really a draught from some "well of
purest English undefil'd," the confusion of ideas could not be more
complete.</p>
<p>Indeed, I very much doubt whether our word "News" contains the
idea of "new" at all. It is used with us to mean intelligence and
the phrases, "Is there any thing new?" and "Is there any news?"
present, in my opinion, two totally distinct ideas to the English
mind in its ordinary mechanical action. "Intelligence" is not
necessarily "new", nor indeed is "News:" in the oldest dictionary I
possess, Baret's <i>Alvearie</i>, 1573, I find "Olde newes or stale
newes." A.E.B. is very positive that "news" is plural, and he cites
the "Cardinal of York" to prove it. All that I can say is, that I
think the Cardinal of York was wrong: and A.E.B. thought so too,
when his object was not to confound me, as may be seen by his own
practice in bloc concluding paragraph of his
communication:&mdash;"The <i>newes</i> WAS of the victory," &amp;c.
The word "means," on the other hand, is beyond all dispute plural.
What says Shakspeare?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Yet nature is made letter by no mean</p>
<p>But nature makes that mean."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The plural was formed by the addition of "<i>s</i>:" yet from
the infrequent use of the word except in the plural, the singular
form has become obsolete, and the same form applies now to both
numbers. Those who would apply this reasoning to "News," forget
that there is the slight difficulty of the absence of the
<i>noun</i> "new" to start from.</p>
<p>I do not feel bound to furnish proof of so obvious a fact, that
many of the most striking similarities in language are mere
coincidences. Words derived from the same root, and retaining the
same meaning, frequently present the most dissimilar appearance, as
"ev&ecirc;que" and "bishop;" and the most distant roots frequently
meet in the same word. When your correspondents, therefore, remind
me that there is a French word, <i>noise</i>, I must remind them
that it contains not one element of our English word. Richardson
gives the French word, but evidently discards it, preferring the
immediate derivation from "<i>noy</i>, that which noies or annoys."
I confess I do not understand his argument; but it was referring to
this that I said that our only known process would make a plural
noun of it. I have an impression that I have met with "annoys" used
by poetical license for "annoyances."</p>
<p>"Noise" has never been used in the sense of the French word in
this country. If derived immediately from the French, it is hardly
probable that it should so entirely have lost every particle of its
original meaning. With us it is either <i>a loud sound</i>, or
<i>fame, report, rumour</i>, being in this sense rendered in the
Latin by the same two words, <i>fama, rumor</i>, as News. The
former sense is strictly consequential to the latter, which I
believe to be the original signification, as shown in its use in
the following passages:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"At the same time it was noised abroad in the realme"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Holinshed</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies</p>
<p>instantly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Ant. and Cleo.</i>, Act i. Sc. 2.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Cre</i>. What was his cause of anger?</p>
<p><i>Ser</i>. The noise goes, this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Troil. and Cres.</i>, Act. i. Sc. 2.</p>
<p>Whether I or your correspondents be right, will remain perhaps
for ever doubtful; but the flight that can discover a relationship
between this word and another pronounced<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> as nearly
the same as the two languages will admit of, and which gives at all
events one sense, if not, as I think, the primary one, is scarcely
so eccentric as that which finds the origin of a word signifying a
loud sound, and fame, or rumor, in "nisus"; not even
<i>struggle</i>, in the sense of <i>contention</i>, an endeavour an
effort, a strain.</p>

<p>I do not think it necessary, here, to defend my pronunciation of
German; the expressions I now use being sufficient for the purpose
of my argument. I passed over CH.'s observation on this subject,
because it did not appear to me to touch the question.</p>

<p>This admired passage has its prototype in the following from the
<i>Lettere di Battista Guarini</i>, who points to a thought of
similar kind in Dante:&mdash;</p>
<p>"O quante nolili ingegni si perdono che riuscerebbe mirabili [in
poesia] se dal seguir le inchinazione loro non fossero, &ograve;
d&agrave; loro appetiti &ograve; da i Padri loro sviati."</p>
<p>Coleridge, in his <i>Bibliographia Literaria</i>, 1st ed., vol.
i. p. 28., relates a story of some one who desired <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>{83}</span> to be
introduced to him, but hesitated because he asserted that he had
written an epigram on "The Ancient Mariner," which Coleridge had
himself written and inserted in <i>The Morning Post</i>, to this
effect:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Your poem must eternal be</p>

</div>
<p>This was, however, only a Gadshill robbery,&mdash;stealing
stolen goods. The following epigram is said to be by Mr. Hole, in a
MS. collection made by Spence (penes me), and it appeared first in

it in his <i>Confusion worse Confounded</i>, p. 88:&mdash;</p>

<h3>STRANGERS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 17.)</h4>
<p>As far as my observation extends, <i>i.e.</i> the last
thirty-one years, no alteration has taken place in the practice of
the House of Commons with respect to the admission of strangers. In
1844 the House adopted the usual sessional order regarding
strangers, which I transcribe, inserting within brackets the only
material words added by Mr. Christie in 1845:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the Serjeant-at-Arms attending this house do, from time to
time, take into his custody any stranger or strangers that he shall
see or be informed of to be in the house or gallery [appropriated
to the members of this house, and also any stranger who, having
been admitted into any other part of the house or gallery, shall
misconduct himself, or shall not withdraw when strangers are
directed to withdraw] while the House or any committee of the whole
House is sitting, and that no person so taken into custody be
discharged out of custody without the special order of the
House.</p>
<p>"That no member of the House do presume to bring any stranger or
strangers into the house, or the gallery thereof, while the House
is sitting."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This order appears to have been framed at a time when there was
no separate gallery exclusively appropriated to strangers, and when
they were introduced by members into the gallery of what is called
the "body of the house." This state of things had passed away: and
for a long series of years strangers had been admitted to a gallery
in the House of Commons in the face of the sessional order, by
which your correspondent CH. imagines their presence was
"absolutely prohibited."</p>
<p>When I speak of strangers being admitted, it must not be
supposed that this was done by order of the House. No, every thing
relating to the admission of strangers to, and their accommodation
in the House of Commons, is effected by some mysterious agency for
which no one is directly responsible. Mr. Barry has built galleries
for strangers in the new house; but if the matter were made a
subject of inquiry, it probably would puzzle him to state under
what authority he has acted.</p>
<p>Mr. Christie wished to make the sessional order applicable to
existing circumstances; and, it may be, he desired to draw from the
House a direct sanction for the admission of strangers. In the
latter purpose, however, if he ever entertained it, he failed. The
wording of his amendment is obscure, but necessarily so. The word
"gallery," as employed by him, can only refer to the gallery
appropriated to members of the House; but he intended it to apply
to the strangers' gallery. The order should have run thus,
"admitted into any other part of the house, or into the gallery
appropriated to strangers;" but Mr. Christie well knew that the
House would not adopt those words, because they contain an
admission that strangers <i>are</i> present whilst the House is
sitting, whereas it is a parliamentary fiction that they are
<i>not</i>. If a member in debate should inadvertently allude to
the possibility of his observations being heard by a stranger, the
Speaker would immediately call him to order; yet at other times the
right honourable gentleman will listen complacently to discussions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>{84}</span>
arising out of the complaints of members that strangers will not
publish to the world all that they hear pass in debate. This is one
of the consistencies resulting from the determination of the House
not expressly to recognise the presence of strangers; but, after
all, I am not aware that any practical inconvenience flows from it.
The non-reporting strangers occupy a gallery at the end of the
house immediately opposite the Speaker's chair; but the right hon.
gentleman, proving the truth of the saying, "None so blind as he
who will not see," never perceives them until just as a division is
about to take place, when he invariably orders them to withdraw.
When a member wishes to exclude strangers he addresses the Speaker,
saying, "I think, Sir, I see a stranger or strangers in the house,"
whereupon the Speaker instantly directs strangers to withdraw. The
Speaker issues his order in these words:&mdash;"Strangers must
withdraw."</p>

<p class="note"><i>Strangers in the House of Commons</i>.&mdash;As
a rider to the notice of CH. in "NOTES AND QUERIES," it may be well
to quote for correction the following remarks in a clever article

<h3>THE HYDRO-INCUBATOR.</h3>
<p>Most, if not all, of your readers have heard of the
newly-invented machine for hatching and rearing in chickens,
without the maternal aid of the hen; probably many of them have
paid a visit (and a <i>shilling</i>) at No. 4. Leicester Square,
where the incubator is to be seen in full operation. The following
extract will, therefore, be acceptable, as it tends to show the
truth of the inspired writer's words, "There is no new thing under
the sun:"&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Therefore ... it were well we made our remarks in some
creatures, that might be continually in our power, to observe in
them the course of nature, every day and hour. Sir <i>John
Heydon</i>, the Lieutenant of his Majesties Ordnance (that generous
and knowing gentleman and consummate souldier, both in theory and
practice) was the first that instructed me how to do this, by means
of a furnace, so made as to imitate the warmth of a sitting hen. In
which you may lay several eggs to hatch and by breaking them at
several ages, you may distinctly observe every hourly mutation in
them, if you please. The first will be, that on one side you shall
find a great resplendent clearness in the white. After a while, a
little spot of red matter, like blood will appear in the midst of
that clearness, fast'ned to the yolk, which will have a motion of
opening and shutting, so as sometimes you will see it, and straight
again it will vanish from your sight, and indeed, at first it is so
little that you cannot see it, but by the motion of it; for at
every pulse, as it opens you may see it, and immediately again it
shuts, in such sort as it is not to be discerned. From this red
speck, after a while, there will stream out a number of little
(almost imperceptible) red veins. At the end of some of which, in
time, there will be gathered together a knot of matter, which by
little and little will take the form of a head and you will, ere
long, begin to discern eyes and a beak in it. All this while the
first red spot of blood grows bigger and solider, till at length it
becomes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id=
"page85"></a>{85}</span> a fleshy substance, and, by its figure,
may easily be discern'd to be the heart; which as yet hath no other
inclosure but the substance of the egg. But by little and little,
the rest of the body of an animal is framed out of those red veins
which stream out all about from the heart. And in process of time,
that body encloses the heart within it by the chest, which grows
over on both sides, and in the end meets and closes itself fast
together. After which this little creature soon fills the shell, by
converting into several parts of itself all the substance of the
egg; and then growing weary of so strait a habitation, it breaks
prison and comes out a perfectly formed chicken."&mdash;Sir Kenelm
Digby's <i>Treatise of Bodies</i>, Ch. xxiv. p. 274. ed. 1669.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could Sir Kenelm return to the scenes of this upper world, and
pay a visit to Mr. Cantelo's machine, his shade might say with
truthfulness, what Horace Smith's mummy answered to his
questioner,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;We men of yore</p>
<p>Were versed in all the knowledge you can mention."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The operations of the two machines appear to be precisely the
same: the only difference being the Sir Kenelm's was an
experimental one, made for the purpose of investigating the process
of nature; while Cantelo's, in accordance with "the spirit of the
iron time," is a practical one, made for the purposes of utility
and profit. Sir Kenelm's Treatise appears to have been first
published in the year 1644.</p>

<h3>ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD "PARLIAMENT."</h3>
<p>It has been observed by a learned annotator on the
<i>Commentaries of Blackstone</i>, that, "no inconsiderable pains
have been bestowed in analysing the word 'Parliament;'" and after
adducing several amusing instances of the attempts that have been
made (and those too by men of the most recondite learning) to
arrive at its true radical properties, he concludes his remarks by
observing that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'Parliament' imported originally nothing more than a council or
conference, and that the termination '<i>ment</i>,' in parliament,
has no more signification than it has in <i>impeachment</i>,
<i>engagement</i>, <i>imprisonment</i>, <i>hereditament</i>, and
ten thouand others of the same nature."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He admits, however, that the civilians have, in deriving
testament from <i>testari mentem</i>, imparted a greater
significance to the termination "ment." Amidst such diversity of
opinion, I am emboldened to offer a solution of the word
"Parliament," which, from its novelty alone, if possessing no
better qualification, may perhaps recommend itself to the
consideration of your readers. In my humble judgment, all former
etymologists of the word appear to have stumbled <i>in limine</i>,
for I would suggest that its compounds are "<i>palam</i>" and
"<i>mens</i>."</p>
<p>With the Romans there existed a law that in certain cases the
verdict of the jury might be given CLAM VEL PALAM, viz.,
<i>privily</i> or <i>openly</i>, or in other words, by
<i>tablet</i> or <i>ballot</i>, or by <i>voices</i>. Now as the
essence of a Parliament or council of the people was its
representative character, and as secrecy would be inconsistent with
such a character, it was doubtless a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> that
its proceedings should be conducted "<i>palam</i>," in an open
manner. The absence of the letter "<i>r</i>" may possibly be
objected to, but a moment's reflection will cast it into the shade,
the classical pronunciation of the word <i>palam</i> being the same
as if spelt <i>PARlam</i>; and the illiterate state of this country
when the word Parliament was first introduced would easily account
for a <i>phonetic</i> style of orthography. The words enumerated by
Blackstone's annotator are purely of English composition, and have
no <i>correspondent</i> in the dead languages; whilst
<i>testament</i>, <i>sacrament</i>, <i>parliament</i>, and many
others, are Latin words Anglicised by dropping the termination
"<i>um</i>"&mdash;a great distinction as regards the relative value
of words, which the learned annotator seems to have overlooked.
"<i>Mentum</i>" is doubtless the offspring of "<i>mens</i>",
signifying the mind, thought, deliberation, opinion; and as we find
"<i>palam populo</i>" to mean "<i>in the sight of the people</i>,"
so, without any great stretch of imagination, may we interpret
"<i>palam mente</i>" into "<i>freedom of thought or of
deliberation</i>" or "<i>an open expression of opinion</i>:" the
essential qualities of a representative system, and which our
ancestors have been careful to hand down to posterity in a word,
viz., <i>Parliament</i>.</p>

<h3>"INCIDIS IN SCYLLAM, CUPIENS VITARE CHARYBDIM."</h3>
<p>I should be sorry to see this fine old <i>proverb in
metaphor</i> passed over with no better notice than that which
seems to have been assigned to it in Boswell's <i>Johnson</i>.</p>
<p>Erasmophilos, a correspondent of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
in 1774, quotes a passage from Dr. Jortin's <i>Life of Erasmus</i>,
vol. ii. p. 151., which supplies the following particulars,
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. That the line was first discovered by Galeottus Martius of
Narni, A.D. 1476.</p>
<p>2. That it is in lib. v. 301. of the "Alexandreis," a poem in
<i>ten</i> books, by Philippe Gualtier (commonly called "de
Chatillon," though in reality a native of Lille, in Flanders).</p>
<p>3. That the context of the passage in which it occurs is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">"&mdash; Quo tendis inertem</p>
<p>Rex periture, fugam? Nescis, heu perdite, nescis</p>
<p>Quem fugias: hostes incurris dum fugis hostem.</p>
<p>Incidis in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza"></div>
</div>
<p>where the poet apostrophises Darius, who, while <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>{86}</span> flying from
Alexander, fell into the lands of Bessus. (See <i>Selections from
Gent. Mag</i>. vol. ii. p. 199. London, 1814.)</p>
<p class="author">C. FORBES.</p>
<p>This celebrated Latin verse, which has become proverbial, has a
very obscure authority, probably not known to many of your readers.
It is from Gualtier de Lille, as has been remarked by Galeottus
Martius and Paquier in their researches. This Gualtier flourished
in the thirteenth century. The verse is extracted from a poem in
ten books, called the "Alexandriad," and it is the 301st of the 5th
book; it relates to the fate of Darius, who, flying from Alexander,
fell into the hands of Bessus. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash; Quo flectis inertem</p>
<p>Rex periture, fugam? Nescis, heu perdite, nescis,</p>
<p>Quem fugias; hostes incurris dum fugis hostem;</p>
<p><i>Incidis in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim</i>"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As honest JOHN BUNYAN, to his only bit of Latin which he quotes,
places a marginal note: "The Latin which I borrow,"&mdash;a very
honest way; so I I beg to say that I never saw this "Alexandriad,"
and that the above is an excerpt from <i>Menagiana</i>, pub. 1715,
edited by Bertrand de la Monnoie, wherein may also be found much
curious reading and research.</p>

<h3>A NOTE OF ADMIRATION!</h3>
<p>Sir Walter Scott, in a letter to Miss Johanna Baillie, dated
October 12, 1825, (Lockhart's <i>Life of Sir W. S.</i>, vol. vi. p.
82.), says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I well intended to have written from Ireland, but alas! as some
stern old divine says, 'Hell is paved with good intentions.' There
was such a whirl of laking, and boating, and wondering, and
shouting, and laughing, and carousing&mdash;" [He alludes to his
visiting among the Westmoreland and Cumberland lakes on his way
home, especially] "so much to be seen, and so little time to see
it; so much to be heard, and only two ears to listen to twenty
voices, that upon the whole I grew desperate, and gave up all
thoughts of doing what was right and proper on post-days, and so
all my epistolary good intentions are gone to Macadamise, I
suppose, 'the burning marle' of the infernal regions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How easily a showy absurdity is substituted for a serious truth,
and taken for granted to be the right sense. Without having been
there, I may venture to affirm that "Hell is <i>not</i> paved with
good intentions, such things being <i>all lost or dropt on the
way</i> by travellers who reach that bourne;" for, where "Hope
never comes," "good intentions" cannot exist any more than they can
be formed, since to fulfil them were impossible. The authentic and
emphatical figure in the saying is, "The <i>road</i> to hell is
paved with good intentions;" and it was uttered by the "stern old
divine," whoever he might be, as a warning <i>not</i> to let "good
intentions" miscarry for want of being realized at the time and
upon the spot. The moral, moreover, is manifestly this, that people
may be going to hell with "the best intentions in the world,"
substituting all the while <i>well-meaning</i> for
<i>well-doing</i>.</p>

<h3>THE EARL OF NORWICH AND HIS SON GEORGE LORD GORING.</h3>
<p>As in small matters accuracy is of vital consequence, let me
correct a mistake which I made, writing in a hurry, in my last
communication about the two Gorings (Vol. ii., p. 65.). The Earl of
Norwich was not under sentence of death, as is there stated, on
January 8, 1649. He was then a prisoner: he was not tried and
sentenced till March.<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The following notice of the son's quarrels with his brother
cavaliers occurs in a letter printed in Carte's bulky appendix to
his bulky <i>Life of the Duke of Ormond</i>. As this is an unread
book, you may think it worth while to print the passage, which is
only confirmatory of Clarendon's account of the younger Goring's
proceedings in the West of England in 1645. The letter is from
Arthur Trevor to Ormond, and dated Launceston, August 18, 1645.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Goring's army is broken and all his men in disorder. He
hates the council here, and I find plainly there is no love lost;
they fear he will seize on the Prince, and he, that they will take
him: what will follow hereupon may be foretold, without the aid of
the wise woman on the bank. Sir John Colepeper was at Court lately
to remove him, to the discontent of many. In short, the war is at
an end in the West; each one looks for a ship, and nothing
more.</p>
<p>"Lord Digby and Mr. Goring are not friends; Prince Rupert yet
goes with Mr. Goring, but how long that will hold, I dare not
undertake, knowing both their constitutions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be observed that the writer of the letter, though a
cavalier, here calls him <i>Mr. Goring</i>, when as his father was
created Earl of Norwich in the previous year, he was <i>Lord
Goring</i> in cavalier acceptation.</p>
<p>He is indiscriminately called Mr. Goring and Lord Goring in
passages of letters by cavaliers relating to the campaign in the
West of 1645, which occur in Carte's <i>Collection of Letters</i>
(vol. i. pp. 59, 60. 81. 86.).</p>
<p>A number of letters about the son, Lord Goring's proceedings in
the West in 1645 are printed in the third volume of Mr. Lister's
<i>Life of Lord Clarendon</i>.</p>
<p>The Earl of Norwich's second son, Charles, who afterwards
succeeded as second earl, commanded a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span> brigade
under his brother in the West in 1645. (Bulstrode's <i>Memoirs</i>,
p. 142.; Carte's <i>Letters</i>, i. 116. 121.)</p>
<p>Some account of the father, Earl of Norwich's operations against
the parliament in Essex in 1648, is given in a curious
autobiography of Arthur Wilson, the author of the <i>History of
James I</i>., which is printed in Peck's <i>Desiderata Curiosa</i>,
book xi. part 5. Wilson was living at the time in Essex.</p>
<p>An interesting fragment of a letter from Goring the son to the
Earl of Dorset, written apparently as he was on the point of
retiring into France, and dated Pondesfred, January 26, 1646, is
printed in Mr. Eliot Warburton's <i>Memoirs of Prince Rupert</i>,
iii. 215.</p>
<p>Mr. Warburton, by the way, clearly confounds the father with the
son when he speaks of the Earl of Norwich's trial and reprieve
(iii. 408.). Three letters printed in Mr. W.'s second volume (pp.
172. 181, 182.), and signed "Goring", are probably letters of the
father's, but given by Mr. Warburton to the son.</p>
<p>I perceive also that Mr. Bell, the editor of the lately
published <i>Fairfax Correspondence</i>, has not avoided confusion
between the father and son. In the first volume of the
correspondence relating to the civil war (p. 281.), the editor
says, under date January, 1646,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lord Hopton in the meanwhile has been appointed to the command
in Cornwall, superseding Goring. Also has been sent off on several
negociations to France."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goring went off to France on his own account; his father was at
that time Charles I.'s ambassador at the court of France.</p>
<p>I should like to know the year in which a letter of Goring the
son's, printed by Mr. Bell in vol. i. p. 23., was written, if it
can be ascertained. As printed, it is dated "Berwick, June 22." Is
<i>Berwick</i> right? Is there a bath there? The letter is
addressed to Sir Constantine Huygens, and in it is this
passage&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have now my lameness so much renewed that I cannot come to
clear myself; as soon as the bath has restored me to my strength, I
shall employ it in his Highness's service, if he please to let me
return into the same place of his favour that I thought myself
happy in before."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should expect that this letter was written from France after
Goring's abrupt retreat into that country. It is stated that the
letter comes from Mr. Bentley's collection.</p>
<p>The Earl of Norwich was in Flanders in November 1569, and
accompanied the Dukes of York and Gloucester from Brussels to
Breda. (Carte's <i>Letters</i>, ii. 282.)</p>
<p class="author">CH.</p>
<p>If the following account of the Goring family given by Banks
(<i>Dormant and Extinct Peerage</i>, vol. iii. p. 575.) is correct,
it will appear that the father and both his sons were styled at
different times. "Lord Goring," and that they may very easily be
distinguished.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"George Goring, of Hurstpierpont, Sussex, the son of George
Goring, and Anne his wife, sister to Edward Lord Denny, afterwards
Earl of Norwich, was created Baron Goring in the fourth of Charles
I., and in the xx<sup>th</sup> of the same reign advanced to the
earldom of Norwich, which had become extinct by the death of his
maternal uncle above-mentioned, S.P.M.</p>
<p>"He betrayed Portsmouth, of which he was governor, to the king,
and rendered him many other signal services. He married Mary, one
of the daughters of Edward Nevill, vi<sup>th</sup> Baron of
Abergavenny, and had issue four daughters, and two sons, the eldest
of whom, George, was an eminent commander for Charles I., and best
<i>known as 'General Goring</i>,' and who, after the loss of the
crown to his royal master, retired to the Continent, and served
with credit as lieutenant-general to the King of Spain. He married
Lettice, daughter of Richard Earl of Cork, and died abroad, S.P.,
in <i>the lifetime of his father</i>, who survived till 1662, and
was succeeded by <i>his only remaining son</i>, Charles Lord
Goring, and second Earl of Norwich, with whom, as he left no issue
by his wife, daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Leman, and widow of Sir
Richard Beker, all his honours became extinct in 1672. He was
unquestionably the Lord Goring noticed by Pepys as returning to
England in 1660, and not the old peer his father, who, if described
by any title, would have been styled 'Earl of Norwich.'"</p>

again." We often inquired, on the return of fine weather, who
Mother Grey was, and what were the peculiar circumstances of the
apples coming round?&mdash;questions, however, which were always
evaded. Now, as the servant was a Cambridge girl, and had a brother
a <i>gyp</i>, or bedmaker, at one of the colleges, besides her
uncle keeping the tennis court there, I have often thought there
must have been some college legend or tradition in Alma Mater, of
Mother Grey and her apples. Will any of your learned

take pity on the natural curiosity of the sex, by furnishing its
details?</p>

<p>The Moly that Hermes to Ulysses gave, is the wild garlick,
[Greek: molu] by some thought the wild rue. (<i>Odyss</i>. b. x. 1.
302.) It is the [Greek: moluza] of Hippocrates, who recommends it
to be eaten as an antidote against drunkenness. But of
<i>Haemony</i> I have been unable to find any reference among our
ordinary medical authorities, Paulus Aeginata, Celsus, Galen, or
Dioscorides. A short note of reference would be very instructive to
many of the readers of Milton.</p>

<p>"Plutarch informs us," says Rollin (<i>Ancient History</i>, vol.
i. p. 65.), "that the god did not compose the verses of the oracle.
He inflamed the Pythia's imagination, and kindled in her soul that
living light which unveiled all futurity to her. The words she
uttered in the heat of her enthusiam, having neither method nor
connection, and coming only by starts, to use that expression
[Greek: eggastrimuthos] from the bottom of her stomach, or rather

<h2>REPLIES</h2>
<h3>PUNISHMENT OF DEATH BY BURNING.</h3>
<p>Probably some of the readers of "NOTES AND QUERIES" will share
in the surprise expressed by E.S.S.W. (Vol. ii., p. 6.), yet many
persons now living must remember when spectacles such as he alludes
to were by no means uncommon. An examination of the newspapers and
other periodicals of the latter half of the eighteenth century
would supply numerous instances in which the punishment of
strangling and burning was inflicted; as well in cases of petit
treason, for the murder of a husband, as more frequently in cases
of coining, which, as the law then stood, was one species of high
treason. I had collected a pretty long list from the <i>Historical
Chronicle</i> in the earlier volumes of the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, but thought it scarcely of sufficient importance to
merit insertion in "NOTES AND QUERIES." Perhaps, however, the
following extracts may possess some interest: one as showing the
manner in which executions of this kind were latterly performed in
London, and the other as apparently furnishing an instance of later
date than that which Mr. Ross considers the last in which this
barbarous punishment was inflicted. The first occurs in the 56th
vol. of the Magazine, Part 1. P. 524., under the date of the 21st
June, 1786&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This morning, the malefactors already mentioned were all
executed according to their sentence. About a quarter of an hour
after the platform had dropped, Phoebe Harris, the female convict,
was led by two officers to a stake about eleven feet high, fixed in
the ground, near the top of which was an inverted curve made of
irons, to which one end of a halter was tied. The prisoner stood on
a low stool, which, after the ordinary had prayed with her a short
time, was taken away, and she hung suspended by the neck, her feet
being scarcely more than twelve or fourteen inches from the
pavement. Soon after the signs of life had ceased, two cartloads of
faggots were placed round her and set on fire; the flames soon
burning the halter, she then sunk a few inches, but was supported
by an iron chain passed over her chest and affixed to the
stake."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crime for which this woman suffered was coining. Probably
the method of execution here related was adopted in consequence of
the horrible occurrence narrated by Mr. Ross.</p>
<p>In vol. lix. of the same Magazine, Part 1. p. 272, under the
date of the <i>18th of March</i>, 1789, is an account of the
executions of nine malefactors at Newgate; and amongst
them,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Christian Murphy, alias Bowman, for coining, was brought out
after the rest were turned off, and fixed to a stake, and burnt,
being first strangled by the stool being taken from under her."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the very slight difference in dates, I am inclined to think
that this is the same case with that alluded to by Mr. Ross.</p>

<h3>TO GIVE A MAN HORNS.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. i. p. 383.)</h4>
<p>Your correspondent L.C. has started a most interesting inquiry,
and your readers must, I am sure, join with me in regretting that
he should have been so laconic in the third division of his Query;
and have failed to refer to, even if he did not quote, the passages
from "late Greek," in which "horns" are mentioned as a symbol of a
husband's dishonor. The earliest notice of this symbolical use of
horns is, I believe, to be found in the <i>Oneirocritica</i> of
Artemidorus, who lived during the reign of Hadrian, A.D.
117-138:</p>
<p>[Greek: "Pepi de ippon en to peri agonon logo proeiraeiai. Elege
de tis theasameno tini epi kriou kathaemenpo, kai pesonti ex autou
ek ton euprosthen, mnaesteuomeno de kai mellonti en autais tais
haemerais tous gamous epetelein, proeipein auto hoti hae gunae sou
porneusei, kai kata to legomenon, kerata soi poiaesei kai outos
apethae, k.t.l."&mdash;Artem. <i>Oneirocritica</i>, lib. ii, cap.
12.]</p>
<p>See Menage, <i>Origines de la Langue Fran&ccedil;oise</i>,
Paris, 1650, in verb. "Cornard." I have only seen Reiff's edition
of Artemidorus, 8vo. Lipsi&aelig;, 1805. His illustrations of the
passage (far too numerous to be quoted) seem to be curious, and
likely to repay the reader for the trouble of examination. His note
commences with a reference to Olaus Borrichius, <i>Antiqua Urb.
Rom. facies</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Alexander Magnus ....successores ejus..... in nummis omnes
cornuti quasi Jovii, honore utique manifesto, donee cornuum decus
in ludibria uxoriorum vertit somnorum interpres Artimidorus."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On which he observes,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ben&egrave;. Nam ante Artimidorium nullus, quod sciam, hujus
scommatis mentionem fecit. Quod enim Traug. Fred. Benedict. ad
Ciceron. <i>Epist. ad Div.</i> 7.24. ad voc. 'Cipius' conjecit, id
paullo audientus mihi videtur conjecisse."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not succeeded in obtaining a sight of this edition of the
Epistles. And I should feel much obliged to any one who would quote
the "conjecture," and so enable your readers to gauge its
"audacity" for themselves. Is it not odd that Reiff should have
made no remark on the utter want of connection between the "honor
manifestus," and the "ludibria" of Olaus? or on the [Greek: kata to
legomenon] of the author that he was illustrating? <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>{91}</span> Artemidorus
may certainly have been the first who <i>recorded</i> the
<i>scomma</i>; but the words [Greek: kata to legomenon] would
almost justify us supposing that</p>

<p class="i8">"&mdash;The horn</p>
<p>Was a crest ere he was born."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Menage (referred to above) evidently lays some stress on the
following epigram, as an illustration of the question:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>[Greek: "Ostis eso purous katalambanei ouk agorazon,</p>
<p>Keinou Amaltheias hae gunae esti keras."]</p>

</div>
<p>Parmenon. <i>Anthol.</i> lib. ii.</p>
<p>But I confess that I am utterly unable to see its point and
therefore cannot, of course, trace its connection with the subject.
Falstaff, it is true, speaks of the "horn of abundance," but then
he assigns it to the husband, and makes the "lightness of the wife
shine through it." (<i>K. Henry IV.</i> Act i. Sc. 2., on which see

<p><i>Why Moses represented with Horns</i>.&mdash;Your

calls the strange practice of making Moses appear horned to a
mistranslation in the Vulgate. I send you an extract from Coleridge
which suggests something more profound the such an accidental
cause; and explains the statement of Rosenm&uuml;ller (p. 419.),
that the Jews attributed horns to Moses "figuratively for
power:"&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I was at Rome, among many other visits to the tomb of
Julius II, I went thither once with a Prussian artist, a man of
great genius and vivacity of feeling. As we were gazing on Michael
Angelo's Moses, our conversation turned on the horns and beard of
that stupendous statue of the necessity of each to support the
other; of the superhuman effect of the former, and the necessity if
the existence of both to give a harmony and <i>integrity</i> both
to the image and the feeling excited by it. Conceive them removed,
and the statue would become <i>un</i>natural without being
<i>super</i>natural. We called to mind the horns of the rising sun,
and I repeated the noble passage from Taylor's <i>Holy Dying</i>.
That horns were the emblem of power and sovereignty among the
Eastern nations; and are still retained as such in Abyssinia; the
Achelous of the ancient Greeks; and the probable ideas and feelings
that originally suggested the mixture of the human and the brute
form in the figure, by which they realised the idea of their
mysterious Pan, as representing intelligence blended with a darker
power, deeper, mightier, and more universal than the conscious
intellect of man; than intelligence&mdash;all these thoughts passed
in procession before our minds."&mdash;Coleridge's <i>Biographia
Literaria</i>, vol. ii. p. 127. edit. 1817.</p>

first opens a little eye of heaven, and sends away the spirits of
darkness, and gives light to a cock, and calls up the lark to
matins, and by and bye gilds the fringes of a cloud, and peeps over
the eastern hills, thrusting out his golden horns like those which
decked the brows of Moses, when he was forced to wear a veil,
because himself had seen the face of God; and still, while a man
tells the story, the sun gets up higher, till he shows a fair face
and a full light, and then he shines one whole day, under a cloud
often, and sometimes weeping great and little showers, and sets
quickly; so is a man's reason and his life."</p>

<p><i>Leicester and the reputed Poisoners of his Time</i> (Vol.
ii., p. 9.).&mdash;"The lady who had lost her hair and her nails,"
an account of whom is requested by your correspondent H.C., was
Lady Douglas, daughter of William Lord Howard of Effingham, and
widow of John Lord Sheffield. Leicester was married to her after
the death of his first wife Anne, daughter and heir of Sir John
Robsart, and had by her a son, the celebrated Sir Robert Dudley,
whose legitimacy, owing to his father's disowning the marriage with
Lady Sheffield, in order to wed Lady Essex, was afterwards the
subject of so much contention. On the publication of this latter
marriage, Lady Douglas, in order, it is said, to secure herself
from any future practices, had, from a dread of being made away
with by Leicester, united herself to Sir Edward Stafford, then
ambassador in France. Full particulars of this double marriage will
be found in Dugdale's <i>Antiquities of Warwickshire</i>.</p>
<p>The extract from D'Israeli's <i>Amenities of Literature</i>
relates to charges against Leicester, which will be found at large
in <i>Leicester's Commonwealth</i>, written by Parsons the
Jesuit,&mdash;a work, however, which must be received with great

Leicester, and his hatred to the Puritans, who were protected by

<p><i>North Sides of Churchyards</i> (Vol. ii., p. 55.).&mdash;A
portion of many churchyards is said to have been left
unconsecrated, though not to be used as playground for the youth of
the parish, but for the burial of excommunicated persons. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>{93}</span>
not, however, always on the north side of the church, as is evident
from the following extract from the Register of Hart,
Durham:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dec. 17. 1596, Ellen Thompson, Fornicatrix (and then
excommunicated), was buried of &THORN;e people in &THORN;e chaer at
the entrance unto &THORN;e &THORN;eate or stile of &THORN;e
churchyard, on the east thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor is the north side of the church always the less favourite
part for burial. I could name many instances where this is the only
part used.</p>
<p>The churchyard now within two hundred yards of me contains about
an acre of ground; the larger portion of which lies to the south of
the church, but has been very little used for sepulture till of
late years, though the churchyard is very ancient. Even now the
poor have an objection to bury their friends there. I believe the
prejudice is always in favour of the part next the town or village;
that on the other side of the church being generally called "the
backside."</p>
<p>I find various notices of excommunicated persons being very
strangely buried, and in extraordinary places, but I have not as
yet met with any act or injunction on the subject. If any of your
readers can supply such a document, it would be extremely
interesting and useful.</p>

<p><i>Monastery, Arrangement of one</i> (Vol. i., p.

<p><i>Churchyards, Epitaphs</i> (Vol. ii., p. 56.).&mdash;I beg to
submit the following observations in answer to the Queries under
this head.</p>
<p>Fairs, and also markets, were held in churchyards until put a
stop to in 1285 by an enactment in the 13 Edw. I. c. 6:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"E communde le rey e defend qe feire ne marche ne seient tenuz
en cimeter pur honur de seint eglise."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previous to the passing of this act, the king had forbidden the
keeping of Northampton fair in the church or churchyard of All
Saints in that town; and Bishop Grost&ecirc;te, following the
monarch's example, had sent instructions through the whole diocese
of Lincoln, prohibiting fairs to be kept in such sacred places.
(See Burn's <i>Eccl. Law</i>, tit. "Church," ed. 1788.) Fairs and
markets were usually held on Sunday, until the 27 Hen. VI. c. 5.
ordered the discontinuing of this custom, with trifling exceptions.
Appended to the fourth Report of the Lincolnshire Architectural
Society is a paper by Mr. Bloxan on "Churchyard Monuments," from
which it appears that in the churchyards of Cumberland and
Cornwall, and in those of Wales, are several crosses, considered to
be as early as, if not earlier than, the twelfth century: that in
the churchyards of the Isle of Man are other crosses of various
dates, from the eighth to the twelfth century and that in some of
the churchyards in Kent, of which those of Chartham, Godmersham,
and Godneston are specified, there are remaining some of the most
simple headstone crosses that can be imagined, most of which the
writer apprehends to be of the twelfth or thirteenth century,
though he adds, "there is no sufficient reason why they should not
be of later date." Several other instances between the periods
particularised are also given. The Report is not published, but
perhaps a copy might be obtained from the printer, W. Edwards, Corn
Market, Louth. See further the <i>Archaeological Journal</i>,
passim, and Mr. Cutt's work on <i>Sepulchral Crosses and Slabs</i>.
The privilege of sanctuary was taken from churchyards, as well as
from all other places, in 1623, by the 21 Jac. I. c. 28., which
provides,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That no sanctuary or privilege of sanctuary shall be hereafter
admitted or allowed in any case" (sec. 7.).</p>

<p><i>Umbrella</i> (Vol. i., p. 415; vol. ii., p.
25.).&mdash;Seeing that the Query respecting this useful article of
domestic economy has been satisfactorily answered, may I be allowed
to mention that umbrellas are described by the ancients as marks of
distinction. Pausanias and Hesychius report that at Alea, a city of
Arcadia, a feast called Scieria was celebrated in honour of
Bacchus, in which the statue of the rosy god was carried in
procession, crowned with vine leaves, and placed upon an ornamental
litter, in which was seated a young girl carrying an umbrella, to
indelicate the majesty of the god. On several bas-reliefs from
Persepolis, the king is represented under an umbrella, which a
female holds over his head.</p>

<p><i>Chantrey's Sleeping Children</i> (Vol. ii., p.
70.)&mdash;Your correspondent PLECTRUM is anxious to know on what
grounds I attribute to Stothard any part of the design of the
monument in Lichfield Cathedral known as Chantrey's "Sleeping
Children?" I will endeavour to satisfy him.</p>
<p>The design, suggested, as it were, by the very nature of the
commission, was communicated by Chantrey to Stothard with a request
that he would make for him two or three sketches of sleeping
children, at his usual price. What Stothard did, I have heard my
father say, was very like the monument as it now stands. The sketch
from which Chantrey wrought was given to me by my father a few
months before his death, and is now suspended on the wall of the
room in which I write.</p>
<p>It is a pencil-sketch, shaded with Indian ink, and is very
Stothard-like and beautiful. It wants, however, a certain
sculptural grace, which Chantrey gave with a master feeling; and it
wants the snow-drops in the hand of the younger sister,&mdash;a
touch of poetic beauty suggested by my father.</p>
<p>The carver of the group (the person who copied it in marble) was
the late Mr. F.A. Leg&eacute;, to whom the merit of the whole
monument has been foolishly ascribed.</p>
<p>I should be sorry to impress the world with the belief that I
mean in any way to detract from the merit of Chantrey in making
this statement. I have divulged no secret. I have only endeavoured
to explain what till now has been too often misunderstood.</p>
<p class="author">PETER CUNNINGHAM.</p>
<p>The following statement may perhaps give to PLECTRUM the
information he requires.</p>
<p>Dining one day alone with Chantrey, in Jan. 1833, our
conversation accidentally turned upon some of his monuments, and
amongst other things he told me the circumstances connected with
the monument at Lichfield to the two children of Mrs. Robinson. As
I was leaving Chantrey, I asked him if I might write down what he
had told me; his reply was, "Certainly; indeed I rather wish you
would." Before I went to bed I wrote down what I now send you; I
afterwards showed it to Chantrey, who acknowledged it to be
correct. It was hastily written, but I send it as I wrote it at the
time, without alteration.</p>
<p>Nicholson, the drawing master, taught Mrs. Robinson and her two
children. Not long after the death of Mr. Robinson, the eldest
child was burnt to death; and a very short time afterwards the
other child sickened and died. Nicholson called on Chantrey and
desired him to take a cast of the child's face, as the mother
wished to have some monument of it. Chantrey immediately repaired
to the house, made his cast, and had a most affecting interview
with the unhappy mother. She was desirous of having a monument to
be placed in Lichfield Cathedral, and wished to know whether the
cast just taken would enable Chantrey to make a tolerable
resemblance of her lost treasure. After reminding her how uncertain
all works of art were in that respect, he assured her he hoped to
be able to accomplish her wishes. She then conversed with him upon
the subject of the monument, of her distressed feelings at the
accumulated losses of her husband and her two children, in so short
a space of time; expatiated upon their characters, and her great
affection; and dwelt much upon her feelings when, before she
retired to bed, she had usually contemplated them when she hung
over them locked in each other's arms asleep. While she dwelt upon
these recollections, it occurred to Chantrey that the
representation of this scene would be the most appropriate
monument; and as soon as he arrived at home he made a small model
of the two children, nearly as they were afterwards executed, and
as they were universally admired. As Mrs. Robinson wished to see a
drawing of the design, Chantrey called upon Stothard, and employed
him to make the requisite drawing from the small model: this was
done; and from this circumstance originated the story, from those
envious of Chantrey's rising fame, that he was indebted to Stothard
for all the merit of the original design.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANIES.</h2>
<p><i>Separation of the Sexes in Time of Divine
Service</i>.&mdash;I note with pleasure that traces of this ancient
usage still exist in parts of Sussex. In Poling Church, and also in
Arundel Church, the movable Seats are marked with the letters M.
and W. respectively, according as they are assigned to the men or
women. On the first Sunday in the year I attended service in
Arundel Church, and observed, with respect to the benches which
were placed in the middle of the nave for the use of the poorer
classes, that the women as they entered proceeded to those at the
eastern end, which were left vacant for them, whilst the men by
themselves <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id=
"page95"></a>{95}</span> occupied those at the western end. The
existence of a distinction of this kind in regard to the open seats
only, affords strong proof, if proof were necessary, that it was
the introduction of appropriated pews which led to the disuse of
else long established, and once general, custom of the men
occupying the south side of the nave, and the women the north.</p>
<p class="author">B.H.B.</p>
<p><i>Error in Winstanley's Loyal
Martyrology</i>.&mdash;Winstanley, in <i>The Loyall Martyrology</i>
(London, printed by Thomas Mabb, 1665), p. 67., says of Master
Gerard, the author of that elaborate herbal which bears his
name&mdash;"This gallant gentleman, renowned for arts and arms, was
likewise at the storming of that (Basing) House unfortunately
slain." According to Johnson, who edited his Herbal in 1633, Gerard
was born at Namptwich, in Cheshire, in the year 1545; and died
about 1607. Basing House was stormed Oct. 1645: had Gerard served
there, he would have been 100 years old. It appears that Winstanley
has confounded Gerard with his editor Thomas Johnson above
mentioned, who was killed during the siege of Basing House, anno
1644. (See Fuller's <i>Worthies</i>, vol. iii. p. 422. edit. 1840.
London.)</p>
<p class="author">E.N.W.</p>
<p><i>Preaching in Nave only.&mdash;Prayers and Preaching distinct
Services</i>&mdash;In Ely Cathedral the old and proper custom of
sermons being delivered in the nave only is still maintained. And
this observance has doubtless led to the continuance of another,
which is a sufficient answer to those who object to the length of
our service, as it shows that formerly in practice, as still in
principle, prayers and preaching were distinct services. In the
morning of Sunday there is no sermon in either of the parish
churches in Ely, but prayers only; and those of the respective
congregations who wish to hear a sermon remove to the cathedral,
where they are joined by the ecclesiastics and others who have
"been to choir". Consequently, any one may "go to sermon" (I use
the language of the place) without having been to prayers, or to
prayers in one of the parish churches, or the choir, without
necessarily hearing the sermon.</p>
<p>I think it would be very interesting, if your widely scattered
correspondents would from time to time communicate in your columns
such instances of any variation from the now usual mode of
celebrating divine service as may fall under their <i>personal</i>
observation.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>It has been frequently, more frequently, perhaps than justly,
objected to the Shakspeare Society, that few of its publications
bear directly upon the illustration of the works of the great
dramatist. That the Council would gladly publish works more
immediately in connection with Shakspeare and his writings, if the
materials for them could be found, is proved by the fact of their
having just published the <i>Remarks of Karl Simrock on the Plots
of Shakspeare's Plays</i>, which that gentleman, whose name is
honoured by all lovers of early German poetry and romance, appended
to the third volume of the <i>Quellen der Shakspeare</i>, a
collection of Novels, Tales, &amp;c., illustrative of Shakspeare,
which Simrock collected and translated in conjunction with
Echtermeyer and Henschel, and which somewhat resembles Mr.
Collier's <i>Shakspeare's Library</i>. The translation of these
remarks, made for the Society, was placed in the hands of Mr.
Halliwell, and forms, with the notes and additions of that
gentleman, a volume containing much new and curious information
upon a very interesting point in Shakspearian literature.</p>

<p>"Ewerby is a magnificent specimen of a Flowing Middle-Pointed
Church. It is most perfectly measured and described: one can follow
the most recondite beauties of the construction, mouldings and
joints, in these Plates, almost as well as in the original
structure. Such a monograph as this will be of incalculable value
to the architects of our Colonies or the United States, who have no
means of access to ancient churches. The Plates are on stone done
with remarkable skill and distinctness. Of Heckington we can only
say that the perspective view from the south-east presents a very
vision of beauty; we can hardly conceive anything more perfect. We

it." &mdash;<i>Ecclesiologist</i> Oct. 1849.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
